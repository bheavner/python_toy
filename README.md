python_toy
===========

I may add badges here

`python_toy` is a skeleton python package for my own learnining.

I'm starting a basic python 3 package, using [virtualenvs](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) and testing with [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html). I'll document how to lint the code and run the tests for this toy example. Pperhaps later I'll add continuous integration with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) and test coverage checks with [coverage.py](http://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  I may also revisit [Sphinx documentation](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.5.1/).
